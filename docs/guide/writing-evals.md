# Writing Evals

This page describes how to author a complete evaluation config for your Skill: how to declare the runtime environment, write cases, and configure grading strategies.

---

## Directory layout

Evaluation files live under the `evals/` folder of your Skill:

```text
my-skill/
  SKILL.md                        # Skill definition
  evals/
    eval.yaml                     # Entrypoint config (required)
    cases/                        # One file per case
      basic-success.yaml
      edge-case-null.yaml
      regression-001.yaml
    fixtures/                     # Optional test resources
      repos/                      # Repository templates
        sample-project/
      diffs/                      # Patch files
        null-check.patch
      scripts/                    # Grading scripts
        check-output.sh
      mcp/                        # MCP server configs
        github.json
```

> **Naming convention:** the case file basename (without `.yaml`) is the case ID. For example, `basic-success.yaml` defines a case with ID `basic-success`.

## eval.yaml — entrypoint config

`eval.yaml` is the global config: *which environment*, *which engine*, *how to grade*.

### Minimal config

```yaml
schema_version: v1alpha1

environment:
  type: none

engine:
  name: claude_code
  model:
    provider: anthropic
    name: claude-sonnet-4-6

cases:
  files:
    - evals/cases/my-test.yaml
```

### Full reference

```yaml
# ========== 1. Schema version ==========
schema_version: v1alpha1          # Fixed value, required

# ========== 2. Runtime environment ==========
environment:
  type: none                      # none / opensandbox / docker

# ========== 3. MCP servers ==========
mcp:
  servers:
    - name: github                # MCP server name
      mode: real                  # real / mocked
      transport: http             # http / stdio; inferred from endpoint/command if omitted
      config_ref: evals/fixtures/mcp/github.yaml  # Path to config file

# ========== 4. Skill installation ==========
skills:
  - source: local_path            # local_path (a directory on disk)
    path: .                       # Path to the Skill

# ========== 5. Agent Engine ==========
engine:
  name: claude_code               # claude_code / codex / qodercli (also accepts qoder-cli) / qwen_code (also accepts qwen-code, qwen)
  model:
    provider: anthropic
    name: claude-sonnet-4-6
    base_url: ""                  # Custom API endpoint (optional)
  # kwargs: { ... }               # Agent-specific switches — see "Engine kwargs" below

# ========== 6. Cases ==========
cases:
  files:                          # Case file paths (relative to the Skill root)
    - evals/cases/basic-success.yaml
    - evals/cases/edge-case.yaml
  defaults:
    timeout_seconds: 300          # Per-case timeout, default 300s
    max_turns: 12                 # Max conversation turns, default 12
    collect_artifacts:            # Glob patterns selecting workspace files to download (see below)
      - "**/*.json"
      - "report/**"
  parallelism: 2                  # Case parallelism, default 1
  retry_policy:
    max_retries: 1
    retry_on: [timeout, error]

# ========== 7. Benchmark (optional) ==========
benchmark:
  enabled: false                  # When true, runs both with_skill and without_skill

# ========== 8. Reports ==========
report:
  formats: [json, html]           # json / junit / html
  artifacts: [transcript]
```

`cases.parallelism` is the file-level default. To override it for a single run, use `skill-up run --parallelism N` without modifying `eval.yaml`. Allowed range: **1 to 256**.

### Engine kwargs (agent-specific switches)

`engine.kwargs` is a free-form string map. Each agent reads only the keys it recognises; unknown keys are ignored. Unrecognised keys (typos like `bypas_sandbox`) emit a DEBUG log line — run with `-v` to surface them. CLI override: `--engine-kwarg key=value` (alias `--ek`), repeatable. Precedence: `--engine-kwarg` > `engine.kwargs` > default.

| key | agent | `true` behaviour | unset / `false` |
| :---: | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| `bypass_sandbox` | `codex` | Forces `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`; overrides the runtime-derived choice. Use when the host kernel lacks Landlock support (e.g. some CI containers) | Default: `none` runtime → `--sandbox workspace-write`; other runtimes already bypass |
| `bypass_sandbox` | `claude_code` | No-op — claude already runs with `--permission-mode=bypassPermissions` | No-op |
| `bypass_sandbox` | `qodercli` | No-op — no equivalent flag | No-op |
| `bypass_sandbox` | `qwen_code` | No-op — `qwen_code` never imposes its own sandbox (`--yolo` only auto-approves tool calls; it does **not** isolate). Like `claude_code`/`qodercli`, isolation is the runtime's job | No-op |

```bash
# One-off override at the call site
skill-up run evals/eval.yaml --engine-kwarg bypass_sandbox=true
```

### Collecting workspace artifacts (`collect_artifacts`)

`collect_artifacts` declares glob patterns that select files from the case workspace to download as run artifacts. After every agent run — **whether it succeeded, failed, or timed out** — matching files are copied to:

```
<output-dir>/<case-id>/<configuration>/outputs/workspace/<relative-path>
```

The matched file's path **relative to the workspace root is preserved**, so `report/run-1/summary.json` lands at `outputs/workspace/report/run-1/summary.json`.

- **Glob syntax** uses [doublestar](https://github.com/bmatcuk/doublestar): `*` matches within a single path segment, `**` matches across directories. Examples: `*.md`, `src/**/*.go`, `report/**`, `**/*.json`.
- **Two layers, merged as a union.** `cases.defaults.collect_artifacts` applies to every case; a case may add its own:

  ```yaml
  # in a case.yaml
  collect_artifacts:
    - "out/**"
  ```

  The per-case list is appended to the defaults and de-duplicated (defaults first).
- **Always collected**, independent of the judge type and of whether the workspace is a git repo. Collection is read-only — it never modifies the workspace.
- The workspace `.git/` directory is **excluded** (an `agent_judge` run commits a baseline there), so a broad pattern like `**` won't sweep VCS internals into the artifacts.

> **Not to be confused with `report.artifacts`** (which selects artifact *types* like `transcript`/`logs`), or with the git workspace diff used by `agent_judge` (a diff *string* fed to the judge, not downloaded files). `collect_artifacts` downloads actual file contents and is orthogonal to both.

### Custom Engine

When `engine.name` is not one of the built-ins (`claude_code`, `codex`, `qodercli`, `qwen_code`), declare an `engine.custom` block so skill-up knows how to invoke your agent. Both `transport: local` (run a command inside the runtime) and `transport: http` (call an HTTP agent service) are supported.

```yaml
engine:
  name: my-agent
  model:
    provider: anthropic
    name: claude-sonnet-4-6
  custom:
    transport: local             # local | http
    response_format: session_result   # session_result (default) | text
    timeout_seconds: 300
    env:                         # credentials and secrets — NEVER reference these in command/args
      MY_AGENT_TOKEN: ${MY_AGENT_TOKEN}
    kwargs:                      # non-secret knobs exposed as ${kwargs.<key>}
      profile: production
    local:
      command: /opt/my-agent/bin/run
      args:
        - --input
        - ${input_file}          # path to the SessionInput JSON skill-up writes
        - --output
        - ${output_file}         # path your agent should write its SessionResult JSON to
      cwd: ${workspace}          # optional; confined to the runtime workspace
      input_file: inputs/messages.json   # optional override (relative to workspace)
      output_file: outputs/session-result.json   # optional override
```

Key fields (full contract in [docs/design/custom-engine.md](../design/custom-engine.md)):

- **`transport`** (required) — how skill-up invokes your agent.
  - `local`: run `local.command` inside the current runtime via `runtime.Exec`. The agent process can read the runtime workspace, installed skills, fixtures, MCP config, and process environment variables.
  - `http`: POST the `SessionInput` to a remote (or local) HTTP agent service and read its `SessionResult` from the response body. Configure it under `custom.http` (see below).
- **`response_format`** (optional, default `session_result`) — how skill-up parses the agent's output.
  - `session_result`: read a full `SessionResult` JSON from `local.output_file` (when configured) or stdout. Carries `exit_code` / `final_message` / `transcript` / `turns` / `input_tokens` / `output_tokens` / `artifacts`. **Recommended**: keeps the full context for judges and reports.
  - `text`: take stdout verbatim as `final_message`. skill-up synthesises a minimal transcript (input messages + the assistant reply) so judges still receive a conversation. Use only for simple scripts that do not produce structured output.
- **`timeout_seconds`** (optional) — per-call deadline. Falls back to the case-level timeout when unset; when both are set, skill-up takes the smaller of the two so the value handed to the agent matches the real wall-clock budget.
- **`env`** (optional) — credentials and secret parameters. Values are injected into the agent process as environment variables. **This is the only channel allowed to carry credentials**: `command` / `args` / `cwd` / `input_file` / `output_file` reject secret-shaped values at config load.
- **`kwargs`** (optional) — non-secret knobs exposed to templates as `${kwargs.<key>}`. Unlike `env`, kwargs are subject to the same strict secret-rejection as command-line fields, so they must not carry credentials or credential-shaped keys.

Template variables available in `command` / `args` / `cwd` / `env` / `input_file` / `output_file`:
`${workspace}`, `${input_file}`, `${output_file}`, `${model}`, `${model_provider}`, `${model_name}`, `${case_id}`, `${variant}`, `${max_turns}`, `${timeout_seconds}`, `${kwargs.<key>}`, plus environment variables via `${VAR}` / `${VAR:-default}` / `${VAR?error message}`.

Secret-handling rules (enforced at config load):

- `${api_key}` and any kwarg whose key looks like a credential (`token`, `secret`, `api_key`, `apiKey`, `bearerToken`, …) cannot be referenced from `command` / `args` / `cwd` / `input_file` / `output_file`. Pass them through `engine.custom.env`, where they reach your agent as process environment variables instead of leaking into process listings.
- `${SOMEVAR:-...}` defaults that contain recognizable credential shapes (`sk-...`, `sk-ant-...`, `ghp_...`, `AIza...`, `AKIA...`, JWTs) are likewise rejected in command-line contexts.

For `transport: http`, configure the call under `custom.http` instead of `custom.local`:

```yaml
engine:
  name: remote-review-agent
  custom:
    transport: http
    response_format: session_result
    timeout_seconds: 300
    kwargs:
      profile: production
    http:
      url: ${CUSTOM_AGENT_ENDPOINT}/v1/run   # required
      method: POST                            # only POST is supported
      headers:
        Authorization: Bearer ${api_key}      # reference secrets here, not in the URL
      files:                                  # optional: upload workspace files as multipart
        - path: diff.patch
          required: true
        - path: "src/**/*.go"
          required: false
      request_body: ${session_input}          # optional; defaults to ${session_input}
```

HTTP specifics:

- The request body defaults to the `SessionInput` JSON. A `request_body` field whose value is exactly `${session_input}`, `${messages}`, or `${kwargs}` is injected as a JSON structure (not a string).
- With `http.files`, the request becomes `multipart/form-data`: the JSON body moves to the `payload` field and each matched file is uploaded as a separate part under the fixed form field name `files`, with its workspace-relative path carried in that part's `filename` (so the server reads each `files` part's `filename`, not a per-path form key). `path` is a workspace-relative file or glob; `required: false` skips a missing/empty match.
- Credentials must be referenced from `headers` (or `request_body`), never from `http.url` — a URL that renders `${api_key}` is rejected to keep the key out of request logs.
- A non-2xx response is treated as an invocation error. Artifacts the agent returns under `artifacts.files[].url` are GET-downloaded (http/https only, no redirects, size/time bounded) into the report directory.

See `docs/design/custom-engine.md` for the full SessionInput / SessionResult schema your agent must conform to.

### MCP configuration

MCP supports `mode: real` and `mode: mocked`. `real` installs a real MCP server into Agents such as `claude_code`, `qodercli`, `codex`, or `qwen_code`; `mocked` makes `internal/mcp` generate a local stdio mock server that is then installed into the Agent like any other MCP server.

HTTP MCP servers can be declared inline or pulled in via `config_ref`:

```yaml
mcp:
  servers:
    - name: agent-sandbox
      mode: real
      transport: http
      config_ref: evals/fixtures/mcp/agent-sandbox.yaml
```

A `config_ref` file supports:

```yaml
transport: http
endpoint: https://mcp.example.com/mcp?token=${MCP_TOKEN}
required_env:
  - MCP_TOKEN
headers:
  PRIVATE-TOKEN: ${PRIVATE_TOKEN}
```

stdio MCP servers use `command` and `args`:

```yaml
mcp:
  servers:
    - name: marker
      mode: real
      transport: stdio
      command: /usr/bin/python3
      args: [evals/fixtures/mcp/marker_server.py]
```

A mocked MCP server can use the built-in `filesystem` mock server directly:

```yaml
mcp:
  servers:
    - name: filesystem
      mode: mocked
```

Or define tool responses through `config_ref`:

```yaml
mcp:
  servers:
    - name: project-mgmt
      mode: mocked
      config_ref: evals/fixtures/mcp/project-mgmt.yaml
```

```yaml
tool_responses:
  create_publish_plan_simple:
    default:
      id: 999
      name: "{{params.name}}"
      status: ONGOING
```

Environment-variable references support both `${VAR}` and full-value `$VAR` forms; the variable name must match `[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*`. Variables listed in `required_env` are injected into the Agent process; full env-var references inside `headers` are also recorded by name so the Agent can pick the right transport mechanism when installing the MCP server.

#### Per-case mocked MCP overrides

Eval-level `mcp.servers` is the default for every case. A case may declare its own `mcp.servers` to vary the mocked fixture while keeping the same server and tool names (introduced by SUP-0003). Servers are merged by `name`: a case-level entry with a matching name replaces that whole eval-level server, and a new name is appended. A case without `mcp` inherits the eval-level config unchanged.

```yaml
# eval.yaml — default fixture shared by all cases
mcp:
  servers:
    - name: project-mgmt
      mode: mocked
      config_ref: evals/fixtures/mcp/project-default.yaml
```

```yaml
# cases/project-open.yaml — same server/tool, different fixture
id: project-open
input:
  prompt: Check the project status and continue the publish plan.

mcp:
  servers:
    - name: project-mgmt
      mode: mocked
      config_ref: evals/fixtures/mcp/project-open.yaml
```

Rules and constraints:

- Case-level servers must use `mode: mocked` in the current MVP; real MCP per-case overrides are not yet supported.
- Replacement is whole-entry, not a field-level merge: provide the full server entry (`name`, `mode`, `config_ref`).
- `config_ref` is resolved relative to the Skill directory (where `SKILL.md` lives), **not** the case file directory — the same rule as eval-level MCP.
- Each case provisions and installs its own mocked server, so fixtures stay isolated even when `cases.parallelism > 1`.

### Choosing a runtime environment

| Environment   | When to use                                       | Example Skills                              |
| :-----------: | :-----------------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------------: |
| `none`        | Plain-text I/O, no filesystem dependencies        | Command routing, Q&A, text generation       |
| `opensandbox` | Requires a remote sandbox service                  | Code review, project scaffolding, scripting |
| `docker`      | Local container isolation, no remote dependency    | Custom toolchains, reproducible CI, offline |

> **Tip:** if your Skill does not touch the filesystem, `none` avoids sandbox provisioning and is significantly faster.

#### OpenSandbox configuration

When `environment.type: opensandbox` is used, sandbox auth is read from the `OPENSANDBOX_API_KEY` environment variable. Non-secret options such as service URL or extension flags belong in `environment.kwargs`. The Agent runtime handles its own binary path; you usually do **not** need to set `PATH` inside the eval config.

```yaml
environment:
  type: opensandbox
  image: registry.example.com/your-org/sandbox-base:latest
  workspace_mount: /workspace
  ready_timeout_seconds: 300
  kwargs:
    base_url: https://agent-sandbox.example.com
    extensions: '{"profile":"ci"}'
    request_timeout_seconds: "900"
    file_transfer_parallelism: "8"
```

Common fields:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `image` | Sandbox image; falls back to the OpenSandbox runtime default when omitted. |
| `workspace_mount` | Workspace path inside the sandbox; defaults to `/workspace`. |
| `env` | Environment variables injected into sandbox commands. To extend `PATH`, use `PATH: $CUSTOM_BIN:$PATH` — the runtime expands it inside the sandbox. |
| `setup_steps` | Init commands executed inside the workspace after the sandbox starts. |
| `kwargs.base_url` | OpenSandbox service URL; can also be set via `OPENSANDBOX_BASE_URL`. |
| `kwargs.extensions` | OpenSandbox extension config as a JSON string. |
| `kwargs.request_timeout_seconds` | Request timeout for the OpenSandbox SDK. |
| `kwargs.file_transfer_parallelism` | Concurrency for directory download. |

#### Docker configuration

When `environment.type: docker` is used, the agent runs inside a local Docker container. This provides container-level isolation (filesystem, process, network) without any remote service dependency.

**Prerequisites:** a working `docker` CLI on PATH and a running Docker daemon. The runtime does not pull images automatically — run `docker pull <image>` beforehand.

```yaml
environment:
  type: docker
  image: node:22                    # Required — must be pre-pulled locally
  workspace_mount: /workspace       # Default: /workspace
  env:
    NPM_CONFIG_REGISTRY: https://registry.npmmirror.com
  setup_steps:
    - run: npm install -g typescript
  entrypoint: ["sleep", "infinity"] # Override container entrypoint (default: sleep infinity)
```

Common fields:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `image` | **Required.** Docker image name. Must be available locally (pre-pull with `docker pull`). |
| `workspace_mount` | Workspace path inside the container; defaults to `/workspace`. Must be absolute. |
| `env` | Environment variables injected into container commands. |
| `setup_steps` | Init commands executed inside the container after it starts. |
| `entrypoint` | Override the container's ENTRYPOINT. Defaults to `["sleep", "infinity"]`. |
| `network_policy` | `deny_all` creates the container with `--network=none` (no network access). `allow_declared` is not yet supported — use `opensandbox` if you need FQDN-level egress filtering. |

> **Tip:** Docker runtime is a good fit for evaluations that need custom system packages, specific language runtimes, or offline/air-gapped environments. For remote sandboxing with managed infrastructure, use `opensandbox` instead.

## case.yaml — evaluation case

Each `.yaml` file under `cases/` defines one case: *what prompt to send* and *how to verify the result*.

### Single-turn case

Most scenarios only need a single-turn prompt:

```yaml
id: find-null-bug
title: Should detect a null pointer bug
description: Verify that the Skill catches null dereferences during code review

input:
  prompt: |
    Review the current diff and report findings.

context:
  repo_fixture: evals/fixtures/repos/null-check-bug    # Load a repo template
  git:
    init: true
    checkout: main
    apply_diff: evals/fixtures/diffs/null-check.patch

constraints:
  timeout_seconds: 180
  max_turns: 8

expect:                           # Cheap gating checks
  must_contain:
    - "null"
    - "bug"
  must_not_contain:
    - "LGTM"
  exit_code: 0

judge:                            # Quality grading
  type: rule_based
  success:
    - output_contains:
        all: ["null", "bug"]
    - exit_code: 0
```

---

## Case context

`context` prepares the initial workspace for a case.

### Load a repository template

```yaml
context:
  repo_fixture: evals/fixtures/repos/my-project    # Copy contents into the workspace
```

### Git operations

```yaml
context:
  repo_fixture: evals/fixtures/repos/my-project
  git:
    init: true
    checkout: feature-branch
    apply_diff: evals/fixtures/diffs/my.patch
    remotes:
      - name: origin
        url: https://github.com/user/repo
```

### Inline files

```yaml
context:
  files:
    "src/main.py": |
      def hello():
          print("Hello World")
    "config.json": |
      {"debug": true}
```

---

## Multi-turn conversations

Use `input.turns` instead of `input.prompt` when your evaluation requires
multiple sequential interactions with the agent — for example, iterative
refinement, phase-gated workflows, or clarification loops.

### When to use `input.prompt` vs `input.turns`

| Scenario | Use |
|----------|-----|
| Single instruction, judge the final output | `input.prompt` |
| Multi-step workflow with inter-turn gates | `input.turns` |
| Iterative refinement (e.g. "now improve naming") | `input.turns` |
| Agent must reject invalid requests mid-conversation | `input.turns` |

### Basic multi-turn case

```yaml
input:
  turns:
    - role: user
      content: "Implement a binary search function in Go."
      post_condition:
        must_contain_all: ["func", "binary"]
        on_fail: fail
    - role: user
      content: "Add unit tests for the function you wrote."
      post_condition:
        must_contain_any: ["Test", "t.Run", "testing"]
        on_fail: fail
```

### `post_condition` — inter-turn gate

`post_condition` checks the agent's response after each turn. It is a **gate**,
not a replacement for the judge. Use it to ensure the conversation stays on
track before sending the next turn.

Fields:

- `must_contain_all`: all strings must appear in the response.
- `must_contain_any`: at least one string must appear.
- `must_not_contain`: none of the strings may appear.
- `on_fail`: what happens when the condition fails:
  - `fail` (default): mark the case as FAIL immediately.
  - `skip_remaining`: skip all subsequent turns; the case result depends on
    what the judge sees.

### `capture` — template variables

Capture values from a turn response for use in later turns:

```yaml
input:
  turns:
    - role: user
      content: "Generate a session token."
      capture:
        - variable: token
          pattern: "token[=: ]+(?P<value>[A-Za-z0-9]+)"
    - role: user
      content: "Verify the token {{token}} is valid."
```

Capture semantics:

- Named group `(?P<value>...)` is preferred; if absent, exactly one unnamed
  capture group is allowed.
- Extractor type: `pattern` (regex) or `jsonpath` — specify exactly one.
- No match or empty value → the case enters ERROR state.
- Variables are scoped to the current case execution only (never shared across
  cases, retries, or baseline variants).
- Referencing an unknown variable fails the turn before the agent is invoked.

### Agent support matrix

| Engine | Multi-turn support | Mechanism |
|--------|-------------------|------------|
| `claude_code` | Yes | `--resume` flag with session ID |
| `qodercli` | Yes | `-r <session-id>` flag |
| `codex` | Yes | `codex resume <thread-id>` command |
| `qwen_code` | Not yet | Falls back to batch mode |
| `custom` | Not yet | Falls back to batch mode |

When an agent does not implement session resumption, all turns are concatenated
and sent as a single prompt. A warning is logged.

### Per-turn judge assertions

The rule-based judge supports per-turn assertions:

```yaml
judge:
  type: rule_based
  success:
    - turn_response_contains:
        turn: 1
        contains_all: ["binary_search"]
    - turn_response_not_contains:
        turn: 2
        not_contains: ["TODO", "FIXME"]
    - tool_called_in_turn:
        turn: 1
        name: write_file
        args:
          path: "search.go"
    - tool_not_called_in_turn:
        turn: 2
        name: delete_file
```

Failure behavior:

- Missing turn (not executed) → assertion fails.
- Skipped/failed/errored turn → assertion fails (only "completed" turns are
  assertable).

## Grading strategies

Grading happens in two layers: **expect** (gating checks) and **judge** (quality assessment).

### expect — fast gating

`expect` is a zero-cost local check. If `expect` fails, `judge` is skipped.

```yaml
expect:
  must_contain:                 # Output must contain ALL of these
    - "review"
    - "bug"
  must_not_contain:             # Output must NOT contain any of these
    - "LGTM"
    - "error"
  exit_code: 0                  # Expected exit code
  files_exist:                  # Files that must exist
    - "review.md"
    - "output.json"
  files_not_exist:              # Files that must not exist
    - "temp.log"
```

### judge: rule_based — deterministic rules

Decide pass/fail by declarative rules — fully deterministic and reproducible:

```yaml
judge:
  type: rule_based
  success:                                    # All conditions must be met
    - output_contains:
        all: ["bug", "null"]                  # Must contain ALL
        any: ["suggest fix", "recommend"]     # Must contain at least one
        not: ["LGTM"]                         # Must NOT contain
    - exit_code: 0
    - tool_called:                            # Agent must invoke this tool
        name: "github::create_pull_request"
        args:                                 # Partial-match against tool args
          title: "Fix null check"
  failure:                                    # If ANY rule matches → immediate fail
    - output_contains:
        any: ["no changes needed", "code is correct"]
```

> **Evaluation order:** `failure` outranks `success`. If any `failure` rule matches, the case fails immediately. Otherwise every `success` rule must pass.

### judge: script — custom script

Run your own script (in any language) to grade results:

```yaml
judge:
  type: script
  script_path: evals/fixtures/scripts/check-quality.sh
  timeout_seconds: 30
```

Script contract:

- Exit code **0** = pass, anything non-zero = fail
- Working directory is the case workspace root
- Available env vars: `$EVAL_FINAL_MESSAGE`, `$EVAL_EXIT_CODE`
- `$EVAL_TRANSCRIPT_PATH` is set only when a transcript was produced; otherwise it is empty
- Stdout from the script is captured as the grading rationale in the report

### judge: agent_judge — LLM rubric

Let an LLM grade against rubric criteria — useful when semantic understanding is required:

```yaml
judge:
  type: agent_judge
  model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6        # Model used by the judge
  skills:                                   # Optional: judge-only Skills
    - source: local_path
      path: evals/fixtures/judge-rubric
  criteria:                                  # Natural-language rubric
    - "Identifies a real bug with an accurate location"
    - "Does not flag correct code as a bug"
    - "Recommendations are actionable, not generic"
  pass_threshold: 0.7                        # Default 0.7
  timeout_seconds: 60                        # Optional: bound a single judge call (0 = no judge-level deadline, parent case timeout still applies)
```

`judge.skills` is supported only for `agent_judge`. These Skills are installed
into the judge agent, not the run agent, and top-level `skills` are not
automatically installed into the judge. In benchmark mode, judge Skills are
installed for both `with_skill` and `without_skill` runs because they are
grading tooling, not the Skill under test. Installation uses each Agent
adapter's native Skill mechanism; skill-up does not concatenate Skill files
into the judge prompt.

`agent_judge` materializes review context into files and injects a small
materials table into the judge prompt. When `judge.context` is omitted, the
default profile is `standard`: `final_message` is included inline, while
`transcript` and `workspace_diff` are provided as file references to avoid
large prompt/argv failures.

Use `minimal` for long repository-change benchmarks where the judge should rely
on explicit attachments or script outputs instead of the full conversation:

```yaml
judge:
  type: agent_judge
  model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6
  context:
    profile: minimal                         # transcript/diff omitted, final_message truncated
    attachments:
      - path: evals/fixtures/diff-result.json
        label: diff_result
  criteria:
    - "Determine whether the reported changes satisfy the expected rules."
```

Per-field modes are available when you need to tune the profile:

```yaml
judge:
  type: agent_judge
  context:
    profile: standard
    final_message: include                   # include | truncate | file_ref | omit
    transcript: file_ref                     # include auto-downgrades to file_ref above limits.max_bytes
    workspace_diff: file_ref
    generated_files: index                   # index | include | omit
    limits:
      max_bytes: 65536
```

> **Cost note:** `agent_judge` consumes additional tokens. Prefer `expect` or `rule_based` for deterministic checks and reserve `agent_judge` for assertions that genuinely require semantic understanding.

---

## Benchmark mode

Setting `benchmark.enabled: true` runs every case **twice**:

1. **with_skill** — Skill installed (treatment)
2. **without_skill** — Skill removed (baseline)

The diff highlights the value the Skill adds (pass-rate uplift, time/token deltas).
For one-off comparisons, `skill-up run ./evals/eval.yaml --baseline` enables the
same mode without changing `eval.yaml`.

```yaml
benchmark:
  enabled: true
```

> **Note:** benchmark mode doubles wall time and token spend. It is disabled by default.

---

## Credentials

Evaluations call Agent Engines and model APIs, so credentials are required. Resolution order, highest priority first:

### 1. CLI flag (transient override)

```bash
skill-up run ./evals/eval.yaml --api-key sk-xxx
```

### 2. Environment variables (recommended)

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-xxx
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxx
skill-up run ./evals/eval.yaml
```

Variables follow the `<PROVIDER>_<FIELD>` pattern. Supported fields: `API_KEY`, `BASE_URL`, `MODEL`.

| Provider  | API Key             | Base URL             | Model              |
| :-------: | :-----------------: | :------------------: | :----------------: |
| anthropic | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` | `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`  |
| openai    | `OPENAI_API_KEY`    | `OPENAI_BASE_URL`    | `OPENAI_MODEL`     |
| other     | `<PROVIDER>_API_KEY`| `<PROVIDER>_BASE_URL`| `<PROVIDER>_MODEL` |

A `.env` file at the project root is also auto-loaded on startup.

### 3. Config file (persistent)

Create `~/.skill-up/credentials.yaml`:

```yaml
providers:
  anthropic:
    api_key: sk-ant-xxx
  openai:
    api_key: sk-xxx
    base_url: https://api.openai.com/v1    # Optional, useful for proxies
```

### qodercli credentials

qodercli authentication is **completely separate** from model-layer credentials such as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. The two layers cannot be mixed.

| Layer              | Environment variable             | Purpose                                                  |
| :----------------: | :------------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------------: |
| qodercli service   | `QODER_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`    | Authenticates against the qodercli service               |
| Model layer        | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, etc.        | Managed internally by qodercli; users do not configure it |

Setup:

```bash
# Option 1: export the env var directly
export QODER_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token_here

# Option 2: write it into the project root .env file
echo 'QODER_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token_here' >> .env
```

> **Tip:** `QODER_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` is optional. When unset, qodercli falls back to the local login state under `~/.qoder/`, the same as running `qodercli` manually. Use `qodercli /login` to log in locally.
>
> **Note:** the `--api-key` flag and any provider API key declared in `eval.yaml` are **not** used as the qodercli auth token. qodercli only reads `QODER_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` or the local login state.

qodercli also has model-parameter restrictions:

- `model` must be one of qodercli's predefined values: `lite`, `efficient`, `auto`, `performance`, `ultimate`
- `base_url` has no effect for qodercli

### qwen_code credentials

[Qwen Code](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code) is an open-source terminal coding agent optimized for Qwen models. The engine name is `qwen_code` (aliases: `qwen-code`, `qwen`), backed by the `@qwen-code/qwen-code` CLI. skill-up installs it on demand via `npm install -g @qwen-code/qwen-code` (Node.js 20+ is bootstrapped automatically), so a manual install is optional.

Qwen Code talks to any **OpenAI-compatible** endpoint, so it reuses the standard OpenAI environment variables — the same plumbing as `codex`:

| Variable          | Purpose                                                    |
| :---------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------: |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`  | API key for the OpenAI-compatible endpoint                 |
| `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | Endpoint base URL (e.g. DashScope OpenAI-compatible mode)  |
| `OPENAI_MODEL`    | Model id; set automatically from `engine.model.name`       |

`provider: openai` (or an empty provider) plus a `base_url` points Qwen Code at a custom gateway; `engine.model.name` / `--model` is forwarded both as the `-m` flag and as `OPENAI_MODEL`. A missing `OPENAI_API_KEY` is informational only — Qwen Code can fall back to local login state under `~/.qwen/` (e.g. Qwen OAuth). Each case runs non-interactively by piping the instruction to `qwen --yolo`, which auto-approves tool actions.

> **Sandboxing:** `--yolo` auto-approves tool calls but does **not** isolate them — so on the `none` runtime `qwen_code` executes shell/write tools with your host privileges, the same as `claude_code` and `qodercli`. `qwen_code` deliberately does not force qwen's own `-s` sandbox (it requires docker/podman on Linux and is unreliable elsewhere); instead, run untrusted skills under a sandboxed runtime (`environment.type: docker` or `opensandbox`), which isolates every engine uniformly. On the `none` runtime qwen's "running without a sandbox" notice is left visible as a reminder; under a sandboxed runtime it is silenced (the container is the sandbox).

> **Protocol:** Qwen Code only speaks the **OpenAI-compatible** API (plus Qwen OAuth); it has **no** native Anthropic Messages API mode. To evaluate against an Anthropic-protocol endpoint, use the `claude_code` engine instead (it reads `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`), or front the endpoint with an Anthropic→OpenAI-compatible proxy and pass that proxy's URL as `base_url`.

Minimal local run:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxx
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1

skill-up run ./evals/eval.yaml --engine qwen_code --model qwen3-coder-plus
```

## Worked examples

### Example A — plain-text routing Skill

Lightweight scenario without filesystem state, verifying that the Skill routes the right command:

```yaml
# eval.yaml
schema_version: v1alpha1
environment:
  type: none
engine:
  name: claude_code
  model:
    provider: anthropic
    name: claude-sonnet-4-6
cases:
  files:
    - evals/cases/route-to-summary.yaml
  parallelism: 4                  # Stateless, fully parallelizable
judge:
  type: rule_based
```

```yaml
# cases/route-to-summary.yaml
id: route-to-summary
title: Resource overview should route to `app summary`

input:
  prompt: |
    Show the resource overview of my-app, including machine count.

expect:
  must_contain:
    - "app summary"
  must_not_contain:
    - "app get"

judge:
  type: rule_based
  success:
    - output_contains:
        all: ["app summary", "--name"]
```

### Example B — MCP tool-call Skill

Validate that the Skill invokes a specific MCP tool:

```yaml
# cases/create-plan.yaml
id: create-plan
title: Should call the create-publish-plan tool correctly

input:
  prompt: |
    Create a release plan called "Q1 release" scheduled for 2026-04-03.

judge:
  type: rule_based
  success:
    - tool_called:
        name: "project-mgmt::create_publish_plan_simple"
        args:
          name: "Q1 release"
          planReleaseDate: "2026-04-03"
```

## FAQ

### How are paths in `eval.yaml` resolved?

All paths (including `cases.files` and fixture paths) are resolved relative to the **Skill root** — the directory that contains `SKILL.md`. For example, `evals/fixtures/repos/my-project` means `<skill-root>/evals/fixtures/repos/my-project`.

### When should I use `expect` vs `judge`?

Use `expect` for fast, zero-cost gating (file existence, keyword presence). Use `judge` for richer quality grading. They compose well — when `expect` fails, `judge` is skipped, saving time and tokens.
